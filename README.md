# Anti Qshing Solution (QR Code Scanner)
## Introduction
This project is a secure QR code scanner designed to combat Qshing.

Qshing is a combination of "QR code" and "phishing." It refers to attacks that steal personal and financial information through malicious QR codes. Due to recent incidents of Qshing-related damage, we initiated this project to provide a preventive solution.
